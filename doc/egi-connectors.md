## Description

`argo-egi-connectors` is a bundle of connectors/sync components for various data sources established in EGI infrastructure, most notably GOCDB (EGI topology, downtimes), but there's also support for fetching weights information via VAPOR service and POEM metric profiles.

Bundle consists of the following connectors: 

 - `topology-gocdb-connector.py` 
 - `downtimes-gocdb-connector.py` 
 - `weights-vapor-connector.py` 
 - `poem-connector.py`


Connectors are syncing data on a daily basis. They are aware of the certain customer, associated jobs and their attributes and are generating appropriate data for each job. Data is presented in a form of avro serialized entities that are placed as files in job folders or can be sent to AMS service. Topology, downtimes, weights and POEM profile information all together with a metric results (status messages), represents an input for `argo-compute-engine`.

### Script `replay-avro-data.py`

The bundle also contains a helper script `replay-avro-data.py` which is intended to send data from a generated avro file to AMS service with customizable date. The script is executed manually and it requires that all the parameters needed for AMS service are passed as arguments to the script (AMS host, project, token, topic, report, avro file with the data we want to send, avro schema, message type and date).

## Installation

Installation narrows down to simply installing the package:
	
	yum -y install argo-egi-connectors

**`Components require avro, argo-ams-library and pyOpenSSL packages to be installed/available.`**


| File Types | Destination |
| :--- | :--- |
| Configuration files|  `/etc/argo-egi-connectors`|
| Components|  `/usr/libexec/argo-egi-connectors`|
| Cronjobs (configured to be executed once per day) | `/etc/cron.d` |
| Directory where components will put their files| `/var/lib/argo-connectors/EGI`|

## Configuration

Configuration of all components is centered around two configuration files: `global.conf` and `customer.conf`. Those file contains some shared config options and sections and are _read by every connector_. 

| Configuration file | Description | Shortcut |
| :------- | :--- | :---|
| `global.conf` | Config file consists of global options common to all connectors like the FQDN of AMS service, the path of host certificate to authenticate to a peer, path of correct avro schema and some connection settings like timeout and number of retries. |<a href="#sync1">Description</a>|
| `customer.conf` | This configuration file is specific for each customer and it consists of listed jobs and their attributes | <a href="#sync2">Description</a>|

All configuration files reside in `/etc/argo-egi-connectors/` after the installation of the package. That's the default location that each component will try to read configuration from. Location can be overridden since every component takes `-c` and `-g` arguments to explicitly define the paths to `customer.conf` and `global.conf`, respectively. Example:

	topology-gocdb-connector.py -c /path/to/customer-foo.conf -g /path/to/global-foo.conf


<a id="sync1"></a>

### global.conf

Config file is read by _every_ component because every component needs to, at least, fetch host certificate to authenticate to a peer, find correct avro schema, know the FQDN of AMS service and have connection parameter properly configured. Config options are case insensitive and whole config file is splitted into a few sections:

	[DEFAULT]
	SchemaDir = /etc/argo-egi-connectors/schemas/

Section contains options that will be combined with others mainly to circumvent the inconvenience of listing their values multiple times along the configuration. Every component generates output file in an avro binary format. `SchemaDir` option points to a directory that holds all avro schemas. 

	[General]
	PublishAms = True
	WriteAvro = True

This section currently has two configuration options affecting the type of delivering the output that each connector generates, so all connectors can write avro encoded data to a files or send the same avro encoded data to AMS service. At least one type of delivering the output data must be enabled. 

	[AMS]
	Host = messaging-devel.argo.grnet.gr
	Token = EGIKEY
	Project = EGI
	Topic = TOPIC
	Bulk = 100
	PackSingleMsg = True

Section configures parameters needed for AMS service. These are the complete options needed. Some options can be shared across all customers and some like a `Token` and `Project` can be private to each customer so those options can be specified in `[CUSTOMER_*]` section of related `customer.conf`. Splitting of listed options throughout two configuration files `global.conf` and `customer.conf` works as long as the complete set of options is specified so if `Host`, `Token` and `Bulk` are specified in `global.conf`, then `AmsProject` and `AmsToken` should be specified in `customer.conf`. `Bulk` option specify the number of entites fetched from data source that will be wrapped in same number of AMS messages delivered to service in a single HTTP request. AMS service will be contacted until all fetched entities are delivered. If `PackSingleMsg` is enabled, then all fetched entities will be sent in a single AMS messsage and `Bulk` will be ignored.

	[Authentication]
	VerifyServerCert = False
	CAPAth = /etc/grid-security/certificates
	HostKey = /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
	HostCert = /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
    UsePlainHttpAuth = False
    HttpUser = xxxx
    HttpPass = xxxx

Each component that talks to GOCDB or POEM peer authenticates itself with a host certificate. `HostKey` indicates the private and `HostCert` indicates the public part of certificate. Additionally, server certificate can be validated with the help of `pyOpenSSL` rounding up the mutual authentication. `CAPath` contains certificates of authorities from which chain will be tried to be built upon validating. Basic HTTP authentication is also available for GOCDB-like services meaning that if `UsePlainHttpAuth` is set to `True`, `topology-gocdb-connector.py` and `downtimes-gocdb-connector.py` will use `HttpUser` and `HttpPass` to authenticate to service. Basic HTTP authentication options can be private to each customer so although it can be disabled globally, customer can enable them in `customer.conf` specifying `AuthenticationUsePlainHttpAuth`, `AuthenticationHttpUser` and `AuthenticationHttpPass` in `[CUSTOMER_*]` section.

	[Connection]
	Timeout = 180
	Retry = 3

For every connector, connection will timeout after `180` seconds specified in `Timeout` by default, if peer doesn't respond properly in a given time frame. Connection will try to be established `3` more times (specified in `Retry`) before connector considers peer unavailable.

	[AvroSchemas]
	Downtimes = %(SchemaDir)s/downtimes.avsc
	Poem = %(SchemaDir)s/metric_profiles.avsc
	TopologyGroupOfEndpoints = %(SchemaDir)s/group_endpoints.avsc
	TopologyGroupOfGroups = %(SchemaDir)s/group_groups.avsc
	Weights = %(SchemaDir)s/weight_sites.avsc

This section, together with a `[DEFAULT]` section, constitutes the full path of avro schema file for each component. Avro schema files define the format of the data that each component is writing. `Topology*` schemas are common to `topology-gocdb-connector.py`. 

	[Output]
	Downtimes = downtimes_DATE.avro
	Poem = poem_sync_DATE.avro
	TopologyGroupOfEndpoints = group_endpoints_DATE.avro
	TopologyGroupOfGroups = group_groups_DATE.avro
	Weights = weights_DATE.avro

Section lists all the filenames that each component is generating. Directory is purposely omitted because it's implicitly found in next configuration file. `DATE` is a string placeholder that will be replaced by the date timestamp in format `year_month_day`.

<a id="sync2"></a>

### customer.conf

This configuration file lists all customers, their jobs and appropriate attributes. Customer in an EGI infrastructure could be a specific VO or even a NGI. Job is presented to `argo-compute-engine` as a folder with a set of files that are generated each day and that directs compute engine what metric results to take into account and do calculations upon them.

#### Directory structure

Job folders for each customer are placed under the customer's `OutputDir` directory and appropriate directory names are read from the config file. Segment of configuration file that reflects the creation of directories is for example: 

	[CUSTOMER_C1]
	Name = C1Name1
	OutputDir = /var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer1
	Jobs = JOB_Test1, JOB_Test2

	[JOB_Test1]
	Dirname = C1Testing1

	[JOB_Test2]
	Dirname = C1Testing2


	[CUSTOMER_C2]
	Name = C2Name2
	OutputDir = /var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer2
	Jobs = Job_Test3, JOB_Test4

	[JOB_Test3]
	Dirname = C2Testing1

	[JOB_Test4]
	Dirname = C2Testing2

This will result in the following jobs directories:

	/var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer1/C1Testing1
	/var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer1/C1Testing2
	/var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer2/C2Testing1
	/var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer2/C2Testing2

So there are two customers, C1 and C2, each one identified with its `[CUSTOMER_*]` section. `CUSTOMER_` is a section keyword and must be specified when one wants to define a new customer. Each customer has three mandatory options: `Name`, `OutputDir` and `Jobs`. With `OutputDir` option, customer defines his directory where he'll write job folders and other data. Customer must also specify set of jobs listed in `Jobs` options since it can not exist without associated jobs. The name of the job folder is specified with `Dirname` option of the certain job so `JOB\_Test1`, identified with `[JOB_Test1]` section, will be named `C1Testing1` and it will be placed under customer's `/var/lib/argo-connectors/Customer1/` directory. Each component will firstly try to create described directory structure if it doesn't exist yet. Only afterward it will write its data.

Every connector reads this configuration file because it needs to find out how many customers are there and what are theirs customer and job directory names where they will lay down its files. So `poem-connector.py`, `downtimes-gocdb-connector.py`, `weights-vapor-connector.py` and `topology-gocdb-connector.py`, all of them are writing theirs data in each job directory for each customer. In case of `PublishAms`, appropriate attribute value taken from `Dirname` will be generated for each AMS message designating to which job it applies and then it will be dispatched to AMS service.

#### Job attributes

Besides `Dirname` option that is common for all connectors, some of them have job attributes that are relevant only for them and upon which they are changing their behaviour. Some of those attributes are _mandatory_ like `Profiles`, `PoemNamespace`, `PoemServerHost` and `PoemServerVO` and the other ones like `TopoSelect*` attributes are optional. Segment of configuration file that reflects job attributes is for example: 

	[JOB_EGICritical]
	Dirname = EGI_Critical
	Profiles = ARGO_MON_CRITICAL
	PoemNamespace = ch.cern.SAM
	PoemServerHost = poem-devel.argo.grnet.gr
	PoemServerVO = ops
	TopoFetchType = Sites
	TopoSelectGroupOfEndpoints = Production:Y, Monitored:Y, Scope:EGI
	TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = NGI:EGI.eu, Certification:Certified, Infrastructure:Production, Scope:EGI
	TopoFeedPaging = True

`PoemServerHost` is the URL where Poem server is located, and `PoemServerVO` is VO for which Poem profiles will be fetched. `PoemNamespace` is a namespace for a given profile.

##### GOCDB topology

	[JOB_EGIFedcloud]
	Dirname = EGI_Fedcloud
	Profiles = FEDCLOUD
	PoemNamespace = ch.cern.SAM
	PoemServerHost = poem-devel.argo.grnet.gr
	PoemServerVO = ops
	TopoFeed = https://goc.egi.eu/gocdbpi/
	TopoFetchType = ServiceGroups
	TopoSelectGroupOfEndpoints = Monitored:Y, Scope:EGI, Production:Y
	TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = Monitored:Y, Scope:EGI

This is an example of the job that fetches topology from GOCDB. `Profiles`, `PoemNamespace`, `PoemServerHost` and `PoemServerVO` are attributes relevant to `poem-connector.py` so for this job `poem-connector.py` will write FEDCLOUD profile in EGI_Fedcloud job folder under /EGI directory. `Topo*` attributes are relevant for `topology-gocdb-connector.py`. `TopoFeed` attribute in the context of the GOCDB topology is optional. If it's specified, it will override default source of topology which is https://goc.egi.eu/gocdbpi/ 

Topology is separated in two abstracts: 

- group of groups
- group of service endpoints

Service endpoints are grouped either by the means of _Sites_ or _Service groups_. Those are listed and represented as an upper level abstract of group of service endpoints - group of groups. Customer can fetch either _Sites_ and their corresponding endpoints or _Service groups_ and their corresponding endpoints per job, but not both of them. What is being fetched is specified with `TopoFetchType` option/job attribute. For each abstract there will be written `TopologyGroupOfGroups` and `TopologyGroupOfEndpoints` filenames (specified in `global.conf`) into appropriate job folder. `TopoSelectGroupOfGroups` and `TopoSelectGroupOfEndpoints` options are used for further filtering. Values are set of tags used for picking up matching entity existing in the given abstract. Tags for group of groups are different for Sites and Service groups. In contrary, set of tags for groups of endpoints remains the same no matter what type of fetch customer specified.

So, in a `TopoFetchType` option customer can either specify:

- `ServiceGroups` - to fetch Service groups
- `Sites` - to fetch Sites

###### Tags

Tags represent a fine-grained control of what part of topology each job is interested. It's a convenient way of selecting only certain entities, being it Sites, Service groups or Service endpoints based on appropriate criteria. Tags are optional so if a certain tag for a corresponding entity is omitted, then filtering is not done. In that case, it can be considered that entity is fetched for all available values of an omitted tag.

Group of group tags are different for a different type of fetch. Tags and values for a different entities existing in EGI infrastructure are:

**Sites**

* Certification = `{Certified, Uncertified, Closed, Suspended, Candidate}`
* Infrastructure = `{Production, Test}`
* Scope = `{EGI, Local}`

**ServiceGroups**

* Monitored = `{Y, N}`
* Scope = `{EGI, Local}`

Tags for selecting group of endpoints are:

**Service Endpoints**

* Production = `{Y, N}`
* Monitored = `{Y, N}`
* Scope = `{EGI, Local}`

Additionally, topology can be filtered for certain NGI, Site or ServiceGroup and since they are part of group of groups abstract, those should be specified in `TopoSelectGroupOfGroups` option. Multiple entities can be specified by putting them in parenthesis and separating by comma. Examples:

    TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = NGI:EGI.eu
    TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = Site:egee.srce.hr
    TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = ServiceGroup:(egee.irb.hr,egee.srce.hr)

##### Data feeds

Source of the data for other connectors like `weights-vapor-connector.py` and `downtimes-gocdb-connector.py` are optional and can be specified per job. If specified, they will override their default source of data. Example:

	[JOB_EGICritical]
	Dirname = EGI_Critical
	DowntimesFeed = https://goc.egi.eu/gocdbpi/
	Profiles = ARGO_MON_CRITICAL 
	PoemNamespace = ch.cern.SAM
	PoemServerHost = poem-devel.argo.grnet.gr
	PoemServerVO = ops
	TopoSelectGroupOfGroups = Monitored:Y, Scope:EGI
	WeightsFeed = http://gstat2.grid.sinica.edu.tw/gstat/summary/json/ 

`WeightsFeed` and `DowntimesFeed` are alternative data feeds for this job for connectors `weights-vapor-connector.py` and `downtimes-gocdb-connector.py`, respectively.
